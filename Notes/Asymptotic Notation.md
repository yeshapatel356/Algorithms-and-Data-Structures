# Asymptotic Notation - Runtime of algorithm

## Big - Oh - Worst case
## Big Theta - Θ - Best Case
## Big Omega - Ω - Average Case

### The common algorithmic runtimes from fastest to slowest are:

- constant: Θ(1)
- logarithmic: Θ(log N)
- linear: Θ(N)
- polynomial: Θ(N^2)
- exponential: Θ(2^N)
- factorial: Θ(N!)

## Abstract data Type

- data, operations, error conditions
- implementation invove algorithms along with their time and space complexities
- Eg.:
    - List, stacks, array list
    - Sets, maps, dictionaries, heaps tables
    - graphs
- OPerations:
    - Add
    - Remove
    - Contains
    - Union
    - Find
    - Min
    - Insert
    - Delete
